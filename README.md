RPSLS is a web based rock paper scissors game. I created the game in such a way to have a very broard target audience so all ages could understand the concept easliy and play RPS with differeing levels of dificlulty

### Features left to implement.
- In the future i would like to add in some sort of animation of the two selections going head to head
- In the future i would like to add s system where you only get a certain amount of tries and who ever has the most points wins overall.
